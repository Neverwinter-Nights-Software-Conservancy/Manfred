  <h2 align="center">Manfred Help (v 0.4.1)</h2>
  
  
  <H3 ALIGN="LEFT">What is Manfred?</H3>
  
  <P>
  Manfred is a Cocoa/Objective C based framework for inspecting (and
  eventually
  modifying) resources for the game Neverwinter Nights by Bioware Corp.
  (ERF/GFF based resources, at least).  The primary focus, at least
  initially, is to provide Mac users an easy way to view and document
  resources for the OKDocs project.  Manfred is an affiliated project of 
  the <A HREF="http://openknights.sourceforge.net/">Open Knights consortium</A>.
  </P>
  
  <H3>Why Manfred?</H3>
  
  <P>
  I wanted to call it GNOME for General Neverwinter Object and Module 
  Editor, but apparently this is locked up by some obscure unix desktop
  program.
  And Mighty Manfred was the name of my only gnome PC in my decades of Dungeons and Dragons.  
  He was the sidekick of an illusionist named Tom Terrific.  Bonus points to anyone 
  who understands this relationship.
  </P>
  
  <H3>What can you do with Manfred?</H3>
  
  <P>
  At present you can open an inspector on a variety of NWN data files, using the 
  <I>File:Open</I> menu item (or <CODE>CMD-O</CODE>).  This currently includes modules
  (.mod, .nwn, and .sav) as well as other
   <A HREF="http://nwn.bioware.com/developers/erf.html">ERF</A> and 
   <A HREF="http://nwn.bioware.com/developers/gff.html">GFF</A> format files,
   in particular
  hak files (.hak).  Opening a module may take a while if it's particularly large.  
  </P>
  
  <P>
  For ERF format resources, like modules, the inspector
  will display the contents of the module as a list of resources with 
  their type and codes.  You can open an inspector on some 
  resources by selecting the resources in the list, and then selecting 
  <I>Module:Inspect</I>.  At present GFF format resources (which covers the
  vast majority) and NSS (scripts) are covered.</P>
  
  <P>
  Please note that the display of the resource contents is far from nice, 
  and that there is at present no way to modify and save any resource 
  contents.  GFF resources may be dumped to an HTML-friendly
  format file, by pressing the
  button on the inspector window.
  </P>

  You can monitor recent improvements and updates to Manfred through 
  the <A HREF="ReleaseNotes.html">Release Notes</A>
  </P>
  
  <H3>That's it?  That's not very much.</H3>
  
  <P>
  Well, Manfred was a project mostly to allow me to learn more about 
  implementing something in Objective C.  As such there are a lot of lose 
  ends.  I intend to take it to the point where it can at least save simple 
  changes to GFF resources, and maybe directly open them from files (and 
  from .HAK and ERF files).  Additional capabilities may be added at a 
  later time, if there is interest.
  </P>
  
  <P>
  Note that there are other projects at the Open Knights which may offer 
  better (cross platform) tools.  People are especially directed to the 
  "neveredit" project.
